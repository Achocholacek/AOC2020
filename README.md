Advent of Code 2020 [In probably pretty hacky bad PHP and even worse Python]

I haven't done an Advent of Code in awhile so I thought I'd start again this year.

It's not going to be pretty and some of it might not work, but I'm gonna try, dammit!

*** Now with Python!
I've never used Python prior to this event but I thought it might be fun to see how I can keep up in two languages.
